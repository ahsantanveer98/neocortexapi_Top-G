project name :"Approve prediction of multisequence Learning"
First Task:
To analyse the existing code and understand how learning sequence and prediction work. First i have to start reading of existing code about multisequence learning how its work.I have already read these codes and understood how it is working .

second TASK
The existing code explain parameters collectively configure the HTM model for the experiment. The HTM model is designed to learn and predict sequences in the provided experiment context. Adjusting these parameters allows for fine-tuning the behavior of the HTM algorithm based on the specific requirements of the task at hand. This code sets up and configures a scalar encoder for converting scalar values into a binary representation. The configured encoder is then used in an experiment involving an HTM model to learn and process sequences. The encoder's parameters, such as the width of bins, number of bits, and encoding range, are crucial in defining how scalar values are transformed into a format suitable for the learning task.the code also explain how can activate the Temporal Memory algorithm and how its work.
